New project (no-name), T for temporary &amp; timer

The idea behind this project is to create a modular timer for the speedrunning Community.
Working mostly under Os X and Ubuntu, I have face issues' compatibility concerning most of the timer offer. What i wanna makeis a software who can be used by anyone and under any OS (Windows, Os X, Linux).
